### Q:  How does a video's metadata (e.g. title, description, tags, thumbnail) influence its view count?
## Abstract
This project sampled and analyzed about **30k YouTube videos** using the [Google Cloud YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to determine if a video's metadata fields (**Title, Description, Tags, Duration, Category** and **Thumbnail Image**) can be used to **predict the popularity** of the video (i.e. the view count).  Thumbnail images were passed through the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/) and converted to a list of text labels.  All textual data was pre-processed using **text vectorization** and passed into a regression model using a **Linear Support Vector Regressor** (LinearSVR) in scikit-learn for a **peak R^2 (coefficient of determination) score of ~0.5**.

The **model was interpreted** by examining the **coefficients** assigned to each of the ~2500 features by the LinearSVR, consisting of the Duration and Category fields as well as the vocabulary terms generated by the text vectorizers for each text field.  

## Results
The **Duration field was assigned the largest positive coefficient** and was thus the **best baseline predictor** for video popularity.  Excluding the Duration field, the remaining top 100 model coefficients were found to lie in the 4 text fields as shown in the pie chart below.  Clearly, the **Description field has the highest relative importance** when predicting video popularity as it contains nearly 3 of 5 of the top 100 vocabulary terms whereas the **labels for the thumbnail images** returned by the Google Vision API were **least useful** and only appeared in 3 of the top 100 terms:

### Best Vocabulary Terms
As for the **vocabulary terms** themselves, those that best predict **high view counts** for each of the metadata text fields are shown in the wordcloud below with **larger words representing better predictors** of video popularity (note that **word stemming** was used so the words are frequently missing suffixes):

The **top 40 highest-weighted words within each individual text field**, are also displayed in separate word clouds below:

### Video Categories
Finally, the **video category** played a significant role on the view count prediction in the final model with videos in the **Shows and Music ranking much more highly** than those in the **Nonprofits & Activism, and People & Blogs** categories:
